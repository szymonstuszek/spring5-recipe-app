https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru

Manage your favourite recipes <br/>
Add ingredients, give instructions how to prepare the dish, upload an image of how it looks.<br/> <br/>

Practice of building a CRUD application: <br/>
- setting up a data model with relations (one to one, many to many etc) <br/>
- clean separation into multiple layers, for example services, controllers, converts <br/>
- setting up profiles for development and production <br/>
- using a different database depending on the profile <br/>
- handling exceptions <br/>
- converting entities to dto objects and other way around <br/>
- using the command line runner to bootstrap data into the app <br/>
- writing tests for several layers: controllers, services, converters.<br/>
- handling multipart files: uploading images <br/>

Functionality for adding, reading, updating and deleting entries. <br/>
