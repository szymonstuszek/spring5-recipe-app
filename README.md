Practice of building a CRUD application: <br/>
- setting up a data model with relations (one to one, many to many etc) <br/>
- clean separation into multiple layers, for example services, controllers, converts <br/>
- setting up profiles for development and production <br/>
- using a different database depending on the profile
- handling exceptions
- writing tests for several layers: controllers, services, converters.<br/>
- handling multipart files: uploading images <br/>

Functionality for adding, reading, updating and deleting entries. <br/>
